FOCA

The Pomodoro is a kind of "tomato" that breaks down the task into half an hour or so and concentrates on it for 25 minutes and then rests for 5 minutes. 

Even if the work is not completed, you should take a break and then go to the next tomato time.

After harvesting 4 "tomatoes", you can rest for 15 to 30 minutes.
